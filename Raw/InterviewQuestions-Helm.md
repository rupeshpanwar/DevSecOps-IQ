<summary>Helm</summary>
<br>

  The term "helm" is often used in the context of navigation and refers to a device used for steering ships or boats. It includes the ship's wheel or tiller and any associated equipment needed to control the direction of the vessel.

  In a broader and more metaphorical sense, "at the helm" is an idiom that means in charge or in a position of leadership. For example, a CEO is at the helm of a company, meaning they're the one steering the company in its strategic direction.

   If you're referring to a different context for the word "helm", please provide more information so I can give a more accurate response.

<summary>Helm - Installation</summary>
<br>

  Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deployment of applications and services to your Kubernetes cluster. As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, below are the steps to install Helm:

Download the Helm binary
You can download the Helm binary from the Helm GitHub project page. As of my last update, Helm 3 is the latest version and you should use that unless you have a specific need for a different version. The download links for the various operating systems can be found here: https://github.com/helm/helm/releases

Install the Helm binary
Once you've downloaded the Helm binary, you'll need to install it. The process differs depending on your operating system.

On macOS, you can use Homebrew
   **brew install helm**

On Linux, you'll need to manually install the binary. After downloading, you can move it to your bin folder with the following commands:

```
tar -zxvf helm-v3.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd linux-amd64
sudo mv helm /usr/local/bin/helm
```

Confirm the Installation
You can confirm that Helm is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:
   **helm version**


This should return the version of Helm that you installed.

Please note that to use Helm, you must have a Kubernetes cluster set up and have the kubectl command line (kubectl CLI) installed.
