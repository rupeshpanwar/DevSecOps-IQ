<summary>Helm</summary>
<br>

  The term "helm" is often used in the context of navigation and refers to a device used for steering ships or boats. It includes the ship's wheel or tiller and any associated equipment needed to control the direction of the vessel.

  In a broader and more metaphorical sense, "at the helm" is an idiom that means in charge or in a position of leadership. For example, a CEO is at the helm of a company, meaning they're the one steering the company in its strategic direction.

   If you're referring to a different context for the word "helm", please provide more information so I can give a more accurate response.

<summary>Helm - Installation</summary>
<br>

  Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deployment of applications and services to your Kubernetes cluster. As of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, below are the steps to install Helm:

Download the Helm binary
You can download the Helm binary from the Helm GitHub project page. As of my last update, Helm 3 is the latest version and you should use that unless you have a specific need for a different version. The download links for the various operating systems can be found here: https://github.com/helm/helm/releases

Install the Helm binary
Once you've downloaded the Helm binary, you'll need to install it. The process differs depending on your operating system.

On macOS, you can use Homebrew
   -     brew install helm

On Linux, you'll need to manually install the binary. After downloading, you can move it to your bin folder with the following commands:

```
tar -zxvf helm-v3.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd linux-amd64
sudo mv helm /usr/local/bin/helm
```

Confirm the Installation
You can confirm that Helm is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:
   -     helm version


This should return the version of Helm that you installed.

Please note that to use Helm, you must have a Kubernetes cluster set up and have the kubectl command line (kubectl CLI) installed.

<summary>Grafana & Prometheus</summary>
<br>

  What is Grafana?

  Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It allows you to visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. It creates visual dashboards for your data to help you better understand what is happening in real time. You can create your own dashboard from your data or use a pre-created dashboard.
  
  What is Prometheus?
  
  Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system and time series database. It collects metrics from monitored targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints. Prometheus is designed for reliability, to be the system you go to during an outage to allow you to quickly diagnose problems.
  
  How do Grafana and Prometheus work together?
  
  Prometheus collects and stores metrics and Grafana visualizes that data. Grafana can query the Prometheus server data source and create dashboard visualizations based on that data. Prometheus and Grafana are often used together in the monitoring and observability stack.
  
  How do you set up Prometheus as a data source in Grafana?
  
  Once you have both Grafana and Prometheus running, you can add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana by following these steps:
  
      Go to Grafana home and click on Configuration (the gear icon on the left), then Data Sources.
      Click Add data source.
      Select Prometheus from the list.
      In the URL box, add your Prometheus server (it's often running on the same machine, so localhost or 127.0.0.1 followed by the port will work).
      Click Save & Test to add the data source.
  
  Can you provide a simple example of a Prometheus query?
  
  Prometheus queries are written in the PromQL language. 
  Here's an example: 
   - the query http_requests_total would give you the total number of HTTP requests recorded by the Prometheus server. You can also get more specific,
 for example
  -  http_requests_total{method="GET", code="200"} would give you the total number of successful GET requests.
  
  How would you set an alert in Grafana?
  
  You can set alerts in Grafana by adding an alert condition to a panel. The process generally involves:
  
      Clicking the title of the panel for which you want to add an alert.
      Clicking Edit.
      On the Alert tab, clicking Create Alert.
      Under Conditions, setting your alerting rule.
      Clicking Save Dashboard.
