  The term "helm" is often used in the context of navigation and refers to a device used for steering ships or boats. It includes the ship's wheel or tiller and any associated equipment needed to control the direction of the vessel.

  In a broader and more metaphorical sense, "at the helm" is an idiom that means in charge or in a position of leadership. For example, a CEO is at the helm of a company, meaning they're the one steering the company in its strategic direction.

   If you're referring to a different context for the word "helm", please provide more information so I can give a more accurate response.
