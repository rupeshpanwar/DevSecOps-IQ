  **What is Terraform, and how does it differ from other Infrastructure-as-Code tools?**
  
  - Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool used to define and manage infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers and on-premises infrastructure. It allows users to define infrastructure resources as code using a declarative syntax, and then use that code to create, modify, and destroy resources.

Compared to other IaC tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet which focus on automating configuration management tasks, Terraform focuses on managing infrastructure resources such as compute instances, storage, network components, and more. Additionally, Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, allowing users to manage resources across heterogeneous environments. Terraform also uses a state file to track resource changes and dependencies, making it easier to maintain and manage complex infrastructure environments.
