      Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It helps automate the deployment and management of applications in a Kubernetes cluster by tracking changes in Git repositories and continuously applying them to the cluster. It ensures that the desired state of the applications in the cluster matches the desired state defined in the Git repository.

      <div class="answer" id="q2">
        Some key features of Argo CD include:
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Declarative GitOps: Argo CD uses declarative YAML manifests stored in a Git repository to define the desired state of the applications. It continuously monitors the repository for changes and automatically applies them to the cluster.</li>
            <li>Application Synchronization: Argo CD compares the desired state defined in the Git repository with the current state of the applications in the cluster. It performs a sync operation to reconcile any differences and bring the cluster to the desired state.</li>
            <li>Rollbacks and Rollouts: Argo CD supports rollback and rollout functionalities, allowing you to easily revert to a previous version of an application or perform controlled deployments with multiple stages.</li>
            <li>Multi-Environment Support: Argo CD can manage applications across multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production. It provides a consistent deployment workflow and allows easy promotion of applications between environments.</li>
            <li>Integration with Git and CI/CD: Argo CD integrates with popular Git providers like GitHub and GitLab, allowing you to store your application manifests in a Git repository. It can also integrate with CI/CD pipelines to trigger deployments automatically when changes are pushed to the repository.</li>
